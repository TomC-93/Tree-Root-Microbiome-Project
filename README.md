# Tree-Root-Microbiome-Project
The scripts contained in this repository relate directly to the work conducted for the Tree Root Microbiome Project (TRMP) led by Dr Steve Wakelin.

## Aim

Helping trees to adapt quickly to climate change by using the genetic information and metabolic pathways of all the organisms existing in intimate partnership with the tree – the microbiome.

## Outcomes

1. Showing how microbiome associations can alter trees’ drought tolerance.

2. Determining if the microbiome relationships that co-evolved with Pinus radiata have been altered/lost with domestication of radiata and if this affects how it adapts to environmental change.

3. Establishing Pinus radiata as the global model for tree-microbiome research, providing a platform for transformative tree and silvicultural science.

4. Ensuring the science is adopted by (a) engaging the international scientific community, (b) working with industry stakeholders, and (c) focussing on science excellence and communication.

5. Developing relationships with conservation and indigenous groups to enable microbiomedriven conservation of Aotearoa NZ’s indigenous tree species and provide new opportunities to expand the diversity of all forests.

6. Creating enduring tree/microbiome groups with increased resilience to climate change and emerging stressors to:

      •  Rescue at-risk species

      • Improve afforestation outcomes by supporting more diverse, productive forests

Support more diverse, productive forests with reduced needs for external inputs

Together, these outcomes will help underpin the carbon neutral economy that is central our government responses to climate change as a species

### Funding Statement:

The TRMP is jointly funded by the MBIE Endeavour Fund and the Forestry Growers Levy Trust, this research programme kicked off in October 2020.
